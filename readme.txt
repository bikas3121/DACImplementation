1. The INL are generated using the random number generator in Matlab and saved in the INL.txt file
	- Run the randomnumbergenerator.m to generate the INL.txt file
	- The range of the INL can be changed by changing the range of random number generator in randomnumbergenerator.m file

2. Run main.py file 

3. The simulation results are stored in simulation_results.csv
4. The plots can be plotted using draw_plots.m file. This is because plots using pyplots are not clear.
