1. The INL are generated using the random number generator in Matlab and saved in the INL.txt file
	- Run the randomnumbergenerator.m to generate the INL.txt file
	- The range of the INL can be changed by changing the range of random number generator in randomnumbergenerator.m file

2. Run main.py file 

3. The simulation results are stored in simulation_results.csv

4. The plots can be plotted using draw_plots.m file. This is because plots using pyplots are not clear. 

5. After completion of simulation, data in txt file is generated by write_data_into_txt_file.m.  

6. Streaming data is stored in OutputData folder. 
	1. samplingtime.txt  - saves the instances of sampling time
	2. filtered_reference.txt - sampled and filtered reference signal ; filter parameters are in the main.py file
	3. mpc_non_uniform_no_INL_feedback.txt - optimal quantizer without INL feedback 
	4. mpc_non_uniform_with_INL_feedback.txt - optimal quantizer with INL feedback
